Please respond with the format /team <action1><action2><action3><action4>. The order that you set the numbers determines the order that they come in. So, if you send /turn 1246, 1 and 2 will lead and 4 and 6 will be on the bench, whereas if you do /turn 4162, then 4 and 1 will lead and 6 and 2 will be on the bench. You need not limit yourself to the set of numbers 1, 2, 4, and 6; any number from 1-6 is acceptable, and each can only be used once.
Do **not** include any extra text, punctuation, or explanation.

Please select the optimal move given this observation. Your response must be of the form [<action1>, <action2>], where action1 and action2 are integers with the following meanings:

action = -2: default
action = -1: forfeit
action = 0: pass
1 <= action <= 6: switch to pokemon <action
7 <= action <= 11: move 1
12 <= action <= 16: move 2
17 <= action <= 21: move 3
22 <= action <= 26: move 4
27 <= action <= 31: move 1 and mega evolve
32 <= action <= 36: move 2 and mega evolve
37 <= action <= 41: move 3 and mega evolve
42 <= action <= 46: move 4 and mega evolve
47 <= action <= 51: move 1 and z-move
52 <= action <= 56: move 2 and z-move
57 <= action <= 61: move 3 and z-move
62 <= action <= 66: move 4 and z-move
67 <= action <= 71: move 1 and dynamax
72 <= action <= 76: move 2 and dynamax
77 <= action <= 81: move 3 and dynamax
82 <= action <= 86: move 4 and dynamax
87 <= action <= 91: move 1 and terastallize
92 <= action <= 96: move 2 and terastallize
97 <= action <= 101: move 3 and terastallize
102 <= action <= 106: move 4 and terastallize

For all move actions, notice that there are 5 allowed values for each slot. This is because the target is also encoded into the action. The target encoding is:
+0: Your Active Pokemon #2
+1: Your Active Pokemon #1
+2: No target (move doesn't target anything)
+3: Opponent's Active Pokemon #1
+4: Opponent's Active Pokemon #2
For example, if I want to use my first Pokemon's first attack on the opponent's second Pokemon and terastallize, and use my second Pokemon's third move on the opponent's first Pokemon, this is how we would derive the action:
1. Our first Pokemon wants to use its first move, which is in the range 7 <= action <= 11, but it wants to terastallize, so the range would be 87 <= action <= 91. We want to target the opponent's second Pokemon, so we take the +4 index of that range, which yields 91.
2. Our second Pokemon wants to use its third move, which is in the range 17 <= action <= 21. We want to target the opponent's first Pokemon, so we take the +3 index of that range, which yields 20.
Therefore, our final answer is [91, 20].

To aid you in making your decision, we provide you action spaces to make sure that your actions are valid. The actions you pick MUST BE INCLUDED in the corresponding list.

The following is the action space of your first Pokemon (the action space for action1):
{action_space1}

The following is the action space of your second Pokemon (the action space for action2):
{action_space2}

NOTE: if both Pokemon are switching, they cannot switch into the same Pokemon. Also, you cannot terastallize with both Pokemon, even if the option is available to both. Only one Pokemon can terastallize.
Therefore, the following example actions are invalid, no matter what the action spaces are:
1. [4, 4] (because that is switching in the same Pokemon for both options)
2. [91, 102] (because that is terastallizing both Pokemon simultaneously)

Please remember, your only allowed response MUST BE of the format [<action1>, <action2>]. PLEASE GIVE NO FURTHER RESPONSE THAN THAT!
